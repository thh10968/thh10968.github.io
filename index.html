			<tr> <p>The ginkgo <span style = "font-style:italic"> (Ginkgo biloba) </span> is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in
the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,” in that there are no closely
related species still extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves.<p>

<p>An unusual biological feature of the ginkgo is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”),
meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit. In this the ginkgo resembles pine trees,
although the ginkgo is deciduous (loses its leaves in the winter).<p>

<p>Ginkgos can be extremely long lived; one ginkgo in Shandong province, China is estimated
to be 3,000 years old.<p>
